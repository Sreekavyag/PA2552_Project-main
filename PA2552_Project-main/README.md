## Setup
### 1. Install Intellij IDEA
IDEA has both a free community version and a paid ultimate version [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).

The community version should be fine for this project, but as students, we can get all paid IntelliJ IDEs for free if you
apply for their student programme [see here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

The project has been tested with `Oracle Open JDK 17` and `Adopt Open JDK 17`.

### 2. Install Git
You can get the git client from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 3. Get the project from the GitHub repository
1. If you don't have a GitHub account, [create one](https://github.com/).
2. If you didn't already get an invitation to the project repository (it's private), ask for it.
3. Open IntelliJ IDEA --> Get from VCS --> Put in this URL: https://github.com/pumpkinsteph/PA2552_Project --> Log in to GitHub and authorize IDEA if needed

### 4. Try running the project!
Important directories are:
- `src\main\java\se\bth\pa2552_project` for the application source code
- `src\test\java\se\bth\pa2552_project` for the (unit & component) tests
